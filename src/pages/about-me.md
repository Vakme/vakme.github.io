I’m a Lead Frontend Developer (Angular/React/Vue) based in Kraków, Poland.
I’m fond of clouds - I work with Azure and AWS, and I also host personal projects on GCP.
My favorite framework is Vue.js, and my preferred backend stack is Node.js with TypeScript.
Recently, I’ve been working more and more with React and React Native.
I enjoy using Nx for monorepo structuring - for it is a great power, and even greater responsibility.
In my free time, I play games (mostly strategy games) and volunteer with the Polish Endometriosis Foundation.
